                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="indent">Hi, my name is Aryon, I’ve always wanted to code programs of my own since I was a kid. I have been taking many steps to my goal of a career in programming of pretty much any sort. From websites to programs, I want to learn it all and I have been working hard to do that. I’ve taken several classes in the realm of coding, such as: Video Game design (Hempfield High School 11th Grade), Interactive Media and Web Design (Lancaster County Career and Technical Center), and currently Computer Software Engineering Technology (Thaddeus Stevens College).</p>
                <p class="indent">As for who I am and my personality, I take my work very seriously and complete work on time. I try to help out with extra work often, especially if I’m all caught up with my own work. I view myself as a friendly person with an outgoing personality. When it comes to dealing with customers, I am able to speak clearly to them and complete their request with ease. I tend to keep solutions and designs simple when completing projects or tasks.</p>
