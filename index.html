                <p class="indent">I am a person who loves videogames, as a kid it has always been my dream to create and design Videogames. I have been taking several steps towards my dream such as a Video Game design class in my highschool, the class for Interactive Media and Web Design where we actually made a game for a project, and now my time in Computer Software Engineering at Thaddeus Stevens.</p>
                <p class="indent">As for my personality, I'd like to say I'm very easy going. I often try to help people where I can and can typically tell if there's something wrong. I usually like to keep things simple as I feel like thats the best way to complete a project.</p>
